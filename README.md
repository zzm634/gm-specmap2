# New Spec Mapper

Now with "Clearcoat"

## Installing

As with most npm projects, run `npm ci` first

Extract the car images into "public/images/car". There should be one subfolder for black, red, green, and blue images.

## Running

`npm run start`
then visit localhost:3000 if it hasn't loaded already.
